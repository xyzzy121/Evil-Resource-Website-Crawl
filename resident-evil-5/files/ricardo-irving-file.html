Crude and arrogant, he possesses an insatiable desire for the accumulation of wealth. It is these traits along with his unique resourcefulness that have most likely made him Tricell's ideal agent in dealings with selling B.O.W.s to black market individuals. The money gained from these dealings is then invested by Tricell Africa back into their bioweapons research and development. The demonstration of those weapons for clients act as operational tests. Given the degree of Irving's involvement, it is believed that he is one of only a handful of people that know the full extent of Tricell's bioweapons business. Irving's activities and their connection to Tricell, however, have been carefully kept under wraps. Adding to the misdirection is the fact that he is officially employed with the Resource Development Division and not the Pharmaceutical Division that sponsors the BSAA. Tricell is a conglomerate comprised of shipping, natural resources development, and pharmaceuticals. each division runs on its own capital, and, as such, could all be considered separate entities under one parent company. Also of note are the divisions that exist between each of Tricell's branch offices. When the BSAA learned of Irving's latest deal, they viewed it as illicit activity conducted on his own and without support from Tricell. BSAA's mission, therefore, was not to fight biological weapons, but to apprehend a smuggler involved in an illicit deal. Irving was able to exploit that misconception to the fullest. Irving was informed of the BSAA's mission, and changed the location of the deal to a mine outside of the Kijuju Autonomous Zone (KAZ). When a BSAA team arrived at what they thought was the deal's location inside the KAZ, they walked into a trap. Before the team even arrived, the improved version of Las Plagas was released upon the populace of the town, transforming most of them into Majini. This intel was acquired by Alpha Team and later confirmed by the data recovered by the backup team (Chris Redfield and Sheva Alomar) prior to Irving's deal. It appears that a sample of the Uroboros Virus was also released upon Alpha Team's arrival and was responsible for the termination of Dan DeChant's team. Irving did not take into account that the Uroboros would be engaged and defeated by Agents Redfield and Alomar, nor that a hard disk and its data would be seized. The data obtained from the hard disk allowed the two agents to proceed to the actual location of Irving's transaction - the mine. When confronted with the reality that his plan had failed, Irving was forced to take the following actions. First, he contacted his partners in the transaction and requested to delay the deal. After which point, he went to the mine to retrieve any documents and materials relevant to the transaction. It was at this point that Redfield and Alomar found him. However, it was obvious that he had a backup plan for just such a contingency. Irving escaped thanks to the help of a hooded figure he had on standby. The two agents were left to deal with Popokarimu (a bat-based B.O.W.) that was originally intended to be used in the transaction. It is thought that Irving released this B.O.W. on the agents in retaliation for disrupting the transaction and not to aid in his escape. It was becoming apparent by this point, that Irving's mental stability was in question. Whether his irrational behavior was brought on by the interference of the agents or if the increased stress only brought out his true tendencies is unknown. Irving's situation, however, would digress even further. After escaping from the mine, he was soon discovered by Captain Josh Stone's Delta Team inside the KAZ. In order to escape Irving unleashed Ndesu (confirmed to be based on the El Gigante B.O.W. used in Europe). The frustration of losing two large, valuable B.O.W.s in such short succession must have been keenly felt by the avaricious Irving. After reaching the conclusion that there was nothing more he could do, Irving plotted to escape with his accumulated wealth, but he was soon overtaken by the hooded figure, who provided him a vial containing Las Plagas. This was to be his punishment for failure. He was to administer this on himself in order to fight the two agents. This vial contained a Las Plagas variant known as a control Plaga. According to BSAA intel, the use of the control Plaga has been documented by Leon S. Kennedy in Europe. The control Plaga differs from the common form in that it does not take over a host's rational thought process. Another difference being that is causes extreme transformations to the host. As such, control Plaga hosts must resign themselves to never being able to live as a normal human again. In a last-ditch effort, Irving detonated the oil refinery, but unfortunately for him the refinery was virtually dry at the time thus limiting the size of the explosion. His hope was that he could destroy all incriminating evidence and kill Agents Redfield and Alomar so he would not have to resort to using the control Plaga. Irving was left with no choice but to administer the injection to himself, at which point he underwent an immense and rapid transformation. But even the power he gained from that transformation did not avail him, and he met his end at the hands of the two agents.","articleSection":"Resident Evil 5 - Library
