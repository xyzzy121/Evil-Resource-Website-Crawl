The fifth head of the Ashford family, Edward Ashford, begins his research into what would later become known as the Progenitor virus. 1962 Ozwell E. Spencer enlists architect George Trevor to design and construct a reclusive mansion on the outskirts of Raccoon City. 1966 (December) Ozwell E. Spencer, James Marcus, and Edward Ashford officially establish the Progenitor virus which reconstitutes a living organism's DNA. 1967 (November) The construction of the mansion and lab facilities in the Arklay Mountains is completed. Jessica and Lisa Trevor are injected with a variant of the Progenitor virus. The virus fails to establish itself in Jessica, and she is subsequently disposed of. The virus shows promise in Lisa, and as a result she is placed under close observation. George Trevor is chosen to be a test subject; however, due to his intimate knowledge of the Mansion Facility, he is disposed of instead. 1968 Construction of Raccoon City's public transit trolleys begins in Europe and they are quickly put to use within the city.
